### Introduction

eduOS-rs is a Unix-like computer operating system based on a monolithic architecture for educational purposes, which is developed for the course [Operating Systems][acsos] at the RWTH Aachen Univeristy.
It is derived from following tutorials and software distributions.

1. Philipp Oppermann's [excellent series of blog posts][opp].
2. Erik Kidd's [toyos-rs][kidd], which is an extension of Philipp Opermann's kernel.
3. The original version of [eduOS][stlankes], which was the old teaching kernel written in C.
